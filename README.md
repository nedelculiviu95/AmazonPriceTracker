# Amazon price tracker using python 

### The code for this project was inspired by Dev Ed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY) 

### I am using this scraper to track the price of the coffe that I used to order from Amazon and it will be really usefull to use when I will be planning to buy more expensive stuff.
